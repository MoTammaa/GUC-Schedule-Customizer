# GUC-Schedule-Customizer
This simple project takes textual GUC schedule, then views tutorial groups individually and supports **Electives** and **Seminar** filtering to help in switching.

It can hide & show 2 electives and filter based on their tutorials optionally. Optionally it can show the seminar.
